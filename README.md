# TV Script Generation using RNN

In this project, I generate a Seinfeld TV scripts using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). I used part of the Seinfeld dataset to train the model, which is available in the data folder. The Neural Network I built generates a new "fake" TV script based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

The methodology and results of the training can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb.

Sample script:
>	jerry: attracted to the top. you know, i think this is the one who laughed.		  
>	george:(still laughing) i just got a message from that.		  
>	jerry: oh yeah, yeah, but i was just wondering if you were here, you didn't even know technically to run.(george accepts his arm roughly, and puts them on his shoulders, flips a box of raisins and gets the aroma of the big guns...		  
>	jerry: no, i don't.		  
>	jerry: what?		  
>	elaine: i don't know, jerry! you know what, maybe i should get the hell out of here! i'm gonna go.(george enters the table)		  
>	george: so what are you saying?		  
>	kramer: well i got it. i can't believe this, jerry.		  
>	george:(to kramer) hey.		  
>	george: hey! what happened?		  
>	jerry: i think so.		  
>	elaine: i don't know. i can't do this.		  
>	kramer:(leaving) hey, how ya doin here?		  
>	george:(shouts) i just spoke to him 'please she mentioned me, i would love to hear it.		  
>	george: what are you talking about? i can't even crawl out of this relationship. i have to go. i think i'll see you.(to jerry) you can take a ride, you got that?		  
>	elaine: oh, yeah, i got some coffee and my helmet.		  
>	jerry:(thinking) what are you doing? you think you can keep this?		  
>	jerry: no.		  
>	elaine: you know, i think it's really funny if you don't even know how to act.		  
>	jerry: you know, i think i should get going.		  
>	jerry:(pause) what?		  
>	kramer:(to george) i don't think so.		  
>	elaine: i think i should get to.		  
>	jerry: well, you know.		  
>	george: yeah, i got that reporter.		  
>	george: i think that's a lot
